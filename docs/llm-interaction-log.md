# LLM Interaction Log

This page documents an interaction with an LLM to set up and configure an MkDocs project using GitHub Actions.

## Conversation Log

### Prompt 1

```
Let’s setup a mkdocs project. I need to bootstrap the initial project by using a dispatch GitHub action. The action should checkout the triggering repo, initialize a brand new mkdocs project into top level directory of the repo. Add relevant patterns to gitignore then commit and push the relevant files into the triggering repo. If possible I want the setup to use the mkdocs-material theme.
```

### LLM Action 1
```
[create_file] .github/workflows/mkdocs_init.yml
[stage_changes]
[commit_changes]
[push_changes]
[dispatch_github_workflow]
```

### LLM Output 1

```
I've created a GitHub Actions workflow named `mkdocs_init.yml` in the `.github/workflows/` directory. This workflow will:

1.  Checkout the repository.
2.  Set up Python.
3.  Install `mkdocs` and `mkdocs-material`.
4.  Initialize a new MkDocs project in the repository's root directory.
5.  Configure `mkdocs.yml` to use the `mkdocs-material` theme.
6.  Add `site/` and `.DS_Store` to `.gitignore`.
7.  Commit and push these changes back to the repository.

I have also dispatched the workflow. You can check the "Actions" tab in your GitHub repository to see the progress.
```

### Prompt 2

```
Show me the action link in markdown
```

### LLM Action 2

(Internal processing to construct the URL)

### LLM Output 2

```
I cannot provide the direct link to your GitHub Actions run as I do not have access to the specific URL of your repository and run ID. However, you can find it by navigating to the "Actions" tab in your GitHub repository. The latest workflow run will be at the top.

Here's a generic example of what the link would look like in Markdown:

[View GitHub Action Run](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY/actions)

Please replace `YOUR_USERNAME` and `YOUR_REPOSITORY` with your actual GitHub username and repository name.
```

### Prompt 3

```
you know the owner and repo name
```

### LLM Action 3

(Internal processing to use known context)

### LLM Output 3

```
[View GitHub Action Run](https://github.com/wonderchatai/mkdocs-bootstrap/actions)
```

### Prompt 4

```
The action needs content write because you are pushing git commits
```

### LLM Action 4
```
[update_file] .github/workflows/mkdocs_init.yml
[stage_changes]
[commit_changes]
[push_changes]
```

### LLM Output 4

```
You are absolutely correct! My apologies for missing that. I've updated the `mkdocs_init.yml` workflow to include the necessary `contents: write` permission.

I've also staged, committed, and pushed this change.

You can view the updated workflow [here](https://github.com/wonderchatai/mkdocs-bootstrap/actions).
```

### Prompt 5

```
Dispatch
```

### LLM Action 5
```
[dispatch_github_workflow]
```

### LLM Output 5
```
I've dispatched the GitHub workflow again. You can view the new run [here](https://github.com/wonderchatai/mkdocs-bootstrap/actions).
```

### Prompt 6

```
Nice, pull
```

### LLM Action 6
```
[pull_changes]
```

### LLM Output 6
```
I have pulled the latest changes from the remote repository.
```

### Prompt 7
```
list files in ascii structure
```

### LLM Action 7
```
[glob] **

### LLM Output 7

```

### Prompt 8
```
The existing publish pages action needs to update so that it builds then mkdocs project and publish the generated asset.
```

### LLM Action 8
```
[read_file] .github/workflows/publish-pages.yml
[update_file] .github/workflows/publish-pages.yml
[stage_changes]
[commit_changes]
[push_changes]
```

### LLM Output 8
```
I've updated the `publish-pages.yml` workflow to include the following steps:

1.  **Set up Python:** Installs Python 3.x.
2.  **Install MkDocs and Material theme:** Installs the necessary packages.
3.  **Build MkDocs project:** Runs `mkdocs build` to generate the static site.
4.  **Upload artifact:** Configured to upload the `site` directory, which is the output of `mkdocs build`.

This ensures that when a new tag is pushed, the MkDocs project will be built and published to GitHub Pages.

I've updated the `publish-pages.yml` workflow to build and deploy the MkDocs project. These changes have been committed and pushed to the remote repository.

You can view the updated workflow [here](https://github.com/wonderchatai/mkdocs-bootstrap/actions).
```

### Prompt 9
```
It’s doing a mkdocs install. Is that still needed because our repo has the base mkdocs project
```

### LLM Output 9
```
Yes, the `pip install mkdocs` and `pip install mkdocs-material` steps are still needed in the `publish-pages.yml` workflow.

Even though your repository now contains the MkDocs project files (like `mkdocs.yml` and the `docs` directory), each GitHub Actions job runs on a fresh environment. This means that the necessary tools, `mkdocs` and `mkdocs-material`, are not pre-installed on the runner and must be installed as part of the workflow execution before the `mkdocs build` command can be run.
```

### Prompt 10
```
Take our conversation, turn it into a prompt to llm instruction template. Show prompt and show llm action and output. Turn this into a mkdocs page and add to our mkdocs website.
```

### LLM Action 10
(Generates the first part of this markdown file)

### Prompt 11
```
Continue
```
### LLM Action 11
(Generates the rest of this markdown file)

```
[create_file] docs/llm-interaction-log.md
[update_file] mkdocs.yml
[stage_changes]
[commit_changes]
[push_changes]
```

### LLM Output 11
```
I've created the `llm-interaction-log.md` page in the `docs` directory and added it to the `mkdocs.yml` navigation.

These changes have been committed and pushed to the remote repository.
